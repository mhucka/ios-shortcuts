## Introduction

This is a collection of [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) that I've written.  I mostly use them on iPhones. You're welcome to copy and use any Shortcut that you find here, although please note that they are written for my needs, and may or may not make sense for anyone else's needs or environments.

There are no releases or versions; I tend to update shortcuts as new ideas or needs arise, and try to remember to save them here.
