# Garlic checker shortcut

My wife is garlic-intolerant (bordering on allergic). Surprisingly many foods have garlic in them. When we're buying something at the grocery store that has an ingredient list, we can at leat read it and check if garlic is one of the ingredients. Reading ingredient lists is time-consuming and tedious, though â€“ and difficult if the font size used to print the ingredient list is very small.

I made this simple shortcut to let us take a picture of an ingredient list, OCR the text, scan the text for "garlic", and report the result.
